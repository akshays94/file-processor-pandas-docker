# File Processing using Python and Pandas


## Running the program

In the terminal, run the following command
```
make run
```


## Using files

In the app folder, create a new folder called `files` and add all the files here.

```
/ app
  / files
    file1.xls
    file2.xlsx
    file3.csv
  ..
  script.py
```

In the script.py, to access `file1.xls` use this path `./files/file1.xls`.


## Writing script

Write your script in the `run()` function in the `script.py` file.

```python
def run():
  ... Your script here ...
```
